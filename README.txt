This is a simple hangman game that uses the console for input. The game chooses a random word from a dictionary file and the user must guess the word one letter at a time. If the user chooses a letter that is not in the word, they will lose a life. If the letter chosen is correct, then no lives are lost, and the blanks in the position(s) of the correct letter is filled in. The game ends when either the word is completely guessed, or the user runs out of lives. The user will be prompted if they would like to play again.
